# Feedback

* The ui design is limited.
* Should write what the numbers mean (especially number of guests)
* Currency after the numbers
* The summary button comes next to "Search" when it is loading (it moves)
* Make pointer icon a hand when hovering over a button, so it is clear that is is clickable. 
* Make the loading icon not stretch when visible.
* Write the total cost furhter down in the sidebar menu, sometimes it gets "lost" with the other text.
* Titles over the columns in the sidebar, e.g "dishes" "prices"
* Make a scrollable list in the sidebar.

# Addressed feedback

* We wrote "person"/"people" after the number of guests parameter in the sidebar to make it more clear by doing a check of how many poeple there are. We also added some space between the buttons there.
* We made the pointer icon a hand when hovering over buttons. By creating a button-style class and using "cursor: pointer;".
